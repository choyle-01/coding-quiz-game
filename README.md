# coding-quiz-game

## Project Description

In this project we were tasked with creating a quiz application from HTML, CSS, and javaScript. When pressing the start button the quiz begins and a question is given. The timer is then displayed this is done by creating a timer function in javascript that triggers when the game screen is displayed. The second task was to display another question when the previous question was answered. This is done by creating a for loop that loops through an array of possible answers and questions and indexing through all of them. We were then to subtract from the time if an answer was written incorrectly. This was done by creating an if statement compairing the chosen answer to the correct answer and subtracting from the remaining time accordingly. The next thing to do was to make the game end when all questions were answered or when the time runs out. This was done by creating another for loop and making sure that they were directed to the end screen when either of those two happened. The next task was to get highscores and initals to display after being submitted to the page. This was done by creating an object and stringifying and parsing it to local storage to save the high scores every time someone submitted. Then the high scores needed to be added back into the page and displayed so that the player could see their initals and high score upon landing on the end screen.
